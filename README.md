1) This simplified the logic by making the code shorter and cleaner
2) I faced issues closing the brackets correctly. I realized I had to close the brackets for the full if statement rather than just the last one.
3) It helped me understand control flow by allowing me to see the structure of the functions. 
4) I used the guess and check and the debugger. I would enter sample values and see if the code worked. I would then press the debugger and check what was wrong with my code.
